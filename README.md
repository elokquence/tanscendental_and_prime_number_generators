# Transcendental and Prime Number Generators

This project is all about numerical methods to perform basic mathematical computations such us searching prime numbers and obtaining irrational numbers such as pi, e and the golden number. Everything this project contains is the material I myself developed during the numerical methods course (part II) on Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Physics degree. In this project you will find the following:

1. Irrational numbers. 
- You can find a pdf document where all the techniques and results are explained in detail and you can find a c++ code to obtain the number e. To my regret, I don't have the scripts to obtain the other numbers but the methods and part of the code can be found on the pdf. I'd like to underline the **obtention of pi using number theory related to the Riemann's Zetta function** (pdf pages 5 to 7). 
2. Prime numbers
- A notebook with a very basic code that enables to get prime numbers vary fast using fancy decorators (njit from numba), basic number theory algorithms and the power of python generators.
